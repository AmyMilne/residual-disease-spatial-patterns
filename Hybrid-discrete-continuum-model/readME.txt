Hybrid Model

The model uses the HAL Java package available at https://halloworld.org/.

In the HAL-master folder place the following java files.

    ExampleGrid.java
    IntermittentTreatment.java

Create an input folder and place the following files inside.

    vesselLocations.csv
    stromaInitialCount.csv
    locationsStroma.csv
    cancerInitialCount.csv
    locationsCancer.csv
    valuesProliferationSignal.csv

In the IntermittentTreatment.java class specify the input and output folders.

IntermittentTreatment.java can now be run.

Data collection needs to be turned on in the code. Please read the note regarding the space requirements.

The initial conditions for domains with different vessel denisties can be accessed in vesselDensity.zip.
